Data binding is the process of converting a JSON data to a Java POJO, vice versa.
It's also referred to as Serializaton/Deserialization.

- Serialization (Java Object → JSON)
    The Java object is converted into a JSON string.
- Deserialization (JSON → Java Object)
    The JSON data is read and automatically mapped into an instance of a Java class.

------------ JSON Data Binding with Jackson ------------
Spring uses the Jackson Project behind the scenes. Spring Boot Starter Web automatically includes dependency for Jackson.
