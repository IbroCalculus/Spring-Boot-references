It is a class that will have all the resource for the API

==== From API.txt, working with the Model class and its corresponding endpoint, we will restructure as follows: ====

- Create a class, ie StudentController.java as shown:


@RestController                    			// Add this annotation
@RequestMapping(path = "api/v1/student")		// This is the endpoint
public class StudentController {

    //	http://localhost:8080/api/v1/student
    @GetMapping()
    public ArrayList<Student> getStudents(){
        Student std1 = new Student(1L,"Student 1","student1@emial.com", LocalDate.of(1998,03,13),23);
        Student std2 = new Student(2L,"Student 2","student2@emial.com", LocalDate.of(2004,07,19),34);
        Student std3 = new Student(3L,"Student 3","student3@emial.com", LocalDate.of(2011,10,22),18);

        ArrayList<Student> students = new ArrayList<>(List.of(std1, std2, std3));
        return  students;
    }
    
    
    
}
