================= WHAT IS SPRINGBOOT? ==============
Spring Framework:
It is a java framework for building java applications, with a lot of modules each designed to handle a specific task.
Modules for: 
	- Handling dependency injections and managing objects (Core modules)
	- Building web applications	(Web modules)
	- Working with databases, SQL or NoSQL, or even in-memory databases. (Data modules)
	- Handling Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) like logging, security.
	- For testing (Test modules)

Downside: A lot of configuration. That's where springboot comes in.

Springboot Framework:
This is built on top of Spring to simply it.


================ STARTING A NEW PROJECT ==============
Go to https://start.spring.io/ to create the project's skeleton

Project -> Maven
Language -> Java
Spring Boot -> 3.2.2

Project Metadata (Do all as needed, I basically change Group: com.ibsu... & Artifact/Name is the project id/name)
Packaging -> Jar
Java -> 21

Add the spring web dependency

Generate and open in InteliJ IDE

=================== STARTING THE SERVER ==================
http://localhost:8080  (OR Change the port if not available via Port number.txt)
NB: This will return a Whitelabel Error Page for now since no API endpoint implemented yet
    CHECK: API.txt


=================== AUTOMATIC RESTART =====================
- Go to mvn repository and search for spring-boot-devtools:
- Go to: pom.xml
- Add the dependency: 

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
    <optional>true</optional>				// Optional means: this is only for this machine, not to be exported.
</dependency>

- Intelij: Goto 'Settings' -> 'Build, Execution, Deployment' -> 'Compiler'; Check: Build Project Automatically.
- Still within 'Settings', -> 'Advanced Settings'; Check: 'Allow auto-make to start even if developed applicaiton is currently running'.

With that, it keeps restarting after some changes within about 2 seconds.
