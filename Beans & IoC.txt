IoC - Inversion of Control: 
Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle in software development where the control of creating and managing objects (or dependencies) is inverted from the developer's code to a framework or container.
In simpler terms:
Instead of your code controlling the flow (like creating objects, managing dependencies), a framework or container takes over this responsibility.
