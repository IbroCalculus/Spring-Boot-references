Spring controller: 

Start with the basics of spring mvc (Spring MVC.txt).

NB: The @Controller annotation marks a class as a Spring MVC Controller, meaning it handles HTTP requests. ie; Tells Spring that this class contains web request handling methods.
It’s a combination of two annotations: 
	@Component → makes the class a Spring Bean (managed by Spring).
	@RequestMapping → allows mapping HTTP requests to methods in this class.


================ Create controller (ie HomeController.java) within java directory: ================

@Controller
public class HomeController {
    @RequestMapping("/home")
    public String index(){
        return "index.html";
    }
}


=============== Create folder 'static' within 'resources' directory, with the 'index.html' file ====================
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World, this is Java SpringBoot</h1>

</body>
</html>


============= Execution =============
Simply run the app. Note that you don't need to do anything within the main.java
