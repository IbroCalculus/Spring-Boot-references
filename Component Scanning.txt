Spring will scan your classes for special annotations, ie; @Component, etc.
After which it will automatically register the beans in the Spring Container.


------------- Scanning ----------
By default, Springs scans every files/folders/subfolders within the same package as the main Spring boot application. Outside the package are not seen by default.

Assume the main application is within this package; 'com.ibsuleiman9.springdemo', while the other one is within 'com.ibsuleiman9.utils'.
By default, the application cannot scan .utils, to fix;

Within the main application, 
Modify from:
	
	@SpringBootApplication
	public class SpringbootDemoApplication {...

To:

@SpringBootApplication(
        scanBasePackages = {
                "com.ibsuleiman9.springboot_demo",
                "com.ibsuleiman9.utils"
        }
)

public class SpringbootDemoApplication {...
