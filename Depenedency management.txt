To build a web application, we need: web server (ie tomcat), libraries for handling web requests (web), building APIs (webmvc), processing json data (ie jackson), logging (logging).
In springboot applications, instead of adding multiple individual libraries, we could simply add a starter dependency (ie spring-boot-starter-web) which is a collection of libraries and frameworks
that have been tested to be used together.

Go to mvn repository website; ie maven central repository (https://central.sonatype.com/) OR MVN Repository (https://mvnrepository.com/)

Search: spring-boot-starter-web
Select and copy the dependency, ie:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    <version>3.5.3</version>
</dependency>

- Paste in pom.xml and sync.

NB: It is advisable to NOT include <version> of dependendencies, let springboot handle that.
